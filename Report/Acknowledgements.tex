\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost I'd like to thank Glenn Strong for agreeing
to supervise this project and providing the inspiration. This
project would not have been possible without his support and
optimism, not to mention his lectures which first introduced
me to these topics. \\ 

\noindent My second reader Andrew Butterfield for the time taken to review
this project. \\

\noindent My family for their support through my degree and acceptance of
my sometimes hermitic work schedule. \\

\noindent Dave and Gareth for moral support and criticism.
