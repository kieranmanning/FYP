\section{Goal}
Javascript through Haskell via some form of core-like intermediate language.
Preserve laziness, typesafety, improve on syntax

\section{Problem Space}
\subsection{Javascript Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Late binding
\item Weak Typing
\item Ganky syntax
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Syntax}
JS syntax is hella pants. Able to fix this though!
\begin{itemize}
\item Generally awkward, verbose
\item JS is Old. New ideas on syntax have emerged
\item Succinct simplicity of syntax in languages such as Python as contrast
\item Overview of ease of writing DSLs in haskell as a solution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Weak Typing}
General type safety issues

\subsubsection{Late Binding}
Efficiency, runtime vs. compile time typing

\section{Existing Solutions}
Fay, iTasks, GHCJS. Why these aren't what I wanted.

\subsection{Fay}
The Fay language, which lives \href[https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki]{"here"}  

\subsection{iTasks? Relevant?}

\subsection{GHCJS}

\subsection{CoffeeScript}
Worth mentioning from point of view of non-functional take on the js problem

\section{Propose solution involving Haskell}
\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss type safety, laziness, ease of haskell/JS interoperability.
\item Compare our core-level output ideas with existing solutions. Include quick chats
	  core/STG in general. Link to SPJ paper(s). Actually, maybe keep chats for later.
\item Worth comparing to ClojureScript 
\end{itemize}

\section{Description of implementation and choices}
\subsection{Core/STG}
link to SPJ etc. papers. Talk about SAPL and the iTasks project.

\subsection{Representing laziness?}
Fay, thunks-as-JS-functions

\subsection{Flow control}
case statement continuations, link to paper

\subsection{Higher order functions}

\subsection{Syntax}
