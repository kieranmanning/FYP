\section{Abstract} 
 This project explores the use of JavaScript as a target language for a Haskell EDSL. Program development in JavaScript is difficult due to various weaknesses in the language design. Rather than attempting to fix the flaws in the language we will explore the practicality of using JavaScript as a target language for developers who wish to work in the higher-level Haskell language. Rather than translating Haskell programs to JavaScript we provide an interpreter which can execute Haskell programs that have been translated to a core language; by taking this approach we are able to discuss the preservation of the program semantics with more confidence than in a direct-translation approach.
