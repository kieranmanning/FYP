NAME
       Catalyst - A Haskell core representation to Javascript compiler

SYNOPSIS
       catalyst [-c] [-r] [-o outfile] -i infile
                [-h | -v]

DESCRIPTION
                        

OPTIONS
        -c, --compile-only
                Output the compiled initial state only, ommitting
                the default serialization process used to create
                a javascript executable represenation of the initial 
                state.

        -v, --version
                version info

        -r, --runtime=FILE
                Append result of compilation to provided runtime, 
                producing a large runable javascript file. By default
                catalyst will only return the compiled state itself.

        -i, --input=FILE
                Name of file to be compiled

        -o, --output=FILE
                Name of file into which resultant compilation will be
                saved. Defaults to a.out.js
